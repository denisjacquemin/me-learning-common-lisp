# Me Learning Common Lisp

Learning Lisp by reading the Practical Common Lisp book, [available for free online](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)
[play! 2.0-beta](http://www.playframework.org/2.0).

This repository includes all my experiments with Common Lisp.

I use and recomend [LispWorks Personal](http://www.lispworks.com/) as local runtime for learning.
